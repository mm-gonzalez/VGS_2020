NEXT MISSION
############

created a folder for all the read textfiles can go to
Visuals file
rename skill_library.py to just skill
create Somone_library.txt along with read file code and update stats upon LV up
create skill_library.txt that is meant to read of skill data
reveiw red dots and delete anything that is no longer need
delint


thinking about dividing the skill class into 4 other classes and revamping
determine skill because it's big and nasty
this decision should be made before creating a "read skill library" function

magic can contain the elmental affinity in order to create weakness/resists
support should not require a hit rate and specify what it's curing (HP, death, status)
tatics won't need a hit roll if it is a buff/debuff but will on status aliments
physical is a netraul affinity and can casue status effects as well
     class Magic(self, name, cost, affinity, status)
     class Support(self, name, cost, effect)
     class tatics(self, name, cost, buff=True, status=False)
     class Physical(self, name, cost, status)

since evrything works the it does, try to create visuals first

*****************************
Shield points
-------------
These are tempory hit points that will deplete first before the users HP goes down
Shocking spells will cause Shield points to deplete faster but are not effective on normal HP

Leader system
-------------
If Someone is the leader, magic attacks/support gain the AOE effect
While they are leader, they cannont use physical attacks unless the skill allows it
Leaders cannot be targeted by physical attacks unless the skill allows it

Someone can move into the frontline to declare someone else as a new leader as their action.
Someone can move into the backline to declare themself as leader as their action. 

Maybe have each indivdual character have a rank/level based on the expereience as a leader
if they are good enough, they can earn perks seperatly

Lv0 Player can check the next person in line while leader can see the entire turn order (this does not use action)
Lv1 Leader can switch into frontline without wasting their action
Lv2 Leader can use 1 item without wasting their action (The 2nd item will spend their turn)
Lv3 Player can switch into backline without wasting their action
Lv4 Leader/Player can switch while allowing the switched person to take their turn instead (turn order stays the same)

The 5th leader perk should be an action that is specific to each character

Paige - Group Gaurd
Leader can command the whole party to gaurd as the leaders action
(This is more effective if she is last, everyone will be able to attack then defend)

Mobius - Aquarius
This an AOE that first deals medium electric damage and then intense water damage
 
Emma - Reconcile

Heals allies includeing Emma. 
If the amount of helaing exceeds their Max health, will begin replenishing shield points

Flint - Metor Shower
Physical but needs magic in order to cast it
Attacks all eniemes up to 3 times, one of those attacks will have a higher chance to crit
all enimes will have an Attack debuff after

06/22
After some thining I've decided that the combat class at the moment is going to
cauase confusion. I can feel myself lost while spawning new ideas that makes things less clear.
I should work on this a later time when my code is more clean
this means that the following task will not be completed later

create Revive skill (smart_choice with reverse=True should help)
create buff/debuff skills
create gaurd skill (gamestate?)


This is what I created so far but most likely will have so revamp completely after

To my future self: It's okay if you don't need to use this code if what you fixed up
is way better
